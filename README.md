User Management Servlet Project
The User Management Servlet Project is a simple web-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL. 
It allows users to manage a list of users with basic functionalities: adding new users, editing existing user details, deleting users, and viewing a list of
all users. The project uses JSP for the frontend and Servlets to handle backend logic, ensuring a clean separation between UI and business logic.

The data is stored securely in a MySQL database, connected via JDBC. The project includes essential web components like web.xml for servlet configuration and 
custom JSP pages for user interaction. It’s designed to be lightweight and easy to set up — just configure the database connection, ensure the mysql-connector.jar 
file is in the lib folder, and deploy the project on an Apache Tomcat server.
